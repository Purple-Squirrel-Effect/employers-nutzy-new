## Integration Instructions

### Method 1: Add to Existing Page

To integrate the AboutUsSection into your existing `index.astro` page:

1. **Import the component:**

```astro
---
import AboutUsSection from "../components/home/AboutUsSection.astro";
// ... other imports
---
```

2. **Add to the page body:**

```astro
<App>
  <HeroSection />
  <JobPlatformSection />
  <!-- Add the About Us section where appropriate -->
  <AboutUsSection />
  <ContentCampainSection />
  <!-- ... other sections -->
</App>
```

### Method 2: Demo Page

A demo page has been created at `src/pages/about-demo.astro` to showcase the component in isolation. You can view it by navigating to `/about-demo` in your browser.

## SVG Illustrations

The following SVG illustrations have been downloaded from Storyset.com and are available in the `public/svg/` directory:

- `Team-work-amico.svg` - Used for team member profiles
- `Team-goals-amico.svg` - Used for team member profiles
- `Team-page-amico.svg` - Used for team member profiles
- `Team-spirit-amico.svg` - Used as background pattern
- `Coworking-amico.svg` - Used for mission section

## Customization

### Content Customization

The component includes TypeScript interfaces for easy content modification:

```typescript
interface TeamMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  expertise: string[];
}

interface CompanyValue {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
}
```

### Styling Customization

The component uses the same styling patterns as other sections:

- Background: `bg-secondary-500`
- Text colors: `text-white`, `text-white/90`, `text-primary-200`, `text-secondary-200`
- Cards: `bg-primary-800` with hover effects
- Spacing: Consistent with other sections (`py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-32`)

## Responsive Design

The component is fully responsive with:

- **Mobile**: Single column layout, smaller text sizes
- **Tablet**: Two-column grids for values and team
- **Desktop**: Multi-column layouts with larger typography

## Performance Considerations

- All images use `loading="lazy"` for better performance
- SVG illustrations are optimized for web
- CSS animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Efficient Tailwind CSS classes minimize bundle size

## Browser Compatibility

The component works across all modern browsers and follows the same compatibility standards as the existing codebase.

## Testing

To test the component:

1. **Development server**: Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `/about-demo`
2. **Visual testing**: Check responsive behavior across different screen sizes
3. **Accessibility testing**: Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
4. **Performance testing**: Verify image loading and animation performance

## Maintenance

The component follows the same maintenance patterns as other sections:

- Content updates can be made by modifying the data arrays
- Styling updates should maintain consistency with the design system
- New team members or values can be added by extending the respective arrays

## Next Steps

1. **Integration**: Add the component to your main page layout
2. **Content Review**: Update team member information and company details as needed
3. **Testing**: Verify the component works correctly in your environment
4. **Customization**: Adjust content and styling to match your specific requirements

The AboutUsSection component is now ready for use and seamlessly integrates with your existing Nutzy website design system.
